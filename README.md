## REAKTOR 8STEPS Sequencer TouchOSC templates

## Description
This repository contains a collection of Reaktor 8STEPS Sequencer TouchOSC templates. The main purpose is to improve your workflow, enjoy and inspire your productions.  The TouchOSC template sends the transport signals (play, stop, bpm) and sequencer values (pitch, gate, velocity, gate rate, gate length, steps, direction, offset, transpose, reset). The Reaktor 8STEPS sequencer sends the midi sequence to other hosted instruments in your DAW.  A return track in your DAW sends back the midi messages to visualize the position steps for an interactive experience.
